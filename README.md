# Learn Golang From Tests

This repo contains the code I went through when practicing learning golang.

I had already gone through other material such as:

- Pluralsight
  - Mike Van Sickle
  - John Sonmez
- Exercism
- Codewars
- LeenCode

I wanted to add it to Github so I could also test using Travis CI.
